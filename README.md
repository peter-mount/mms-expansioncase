This is a simple concept of an expansion enclosure for the MISTer Multi System
case.

It's designed in OpenSCAD and is intended to sit underneath the MMS case:

It's configurable for it's height, images above are 50mm and the cutout's on
the top can be turned off if required - the ones here matches those on the MMS case
although there is an additional one for under the SNAC/Dust cover if needed.

There's the option of placing a similar fan to the one in the main case present
and a slot at the back for a backing plate.

# This is a work in progress, so it's not complete in any manner!
